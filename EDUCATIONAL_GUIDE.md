# 🎓 Educational Guide: Understanding Lunar Phases

This simulation is designed to teach spherical astronomy concepts and help visualize how lunar phases work in our actual universe.

## What You'll Learn

### 1. The Moon Doesn't Glow
The Moon reflects sunlight—it doesn't produce its own light. This is why we see different phases.

### 2. The Sun Always Illuminates Half the Moon
Just like Earth always has a day side and night side, the Moon always has half of its surface lit by the Sun.

### 3. Our Perspective Changes
As the Moon orbits Earth, we see different portions of its illuminated half. This creates the phases.

### 4. It's All About Geometry
The phases are purely geometric—no magic, no conspiracy, just the positions of three spherical objects in space.

## How to Use the Simulation

### Space View (Default)
- Shows the entire Sun-Earth-Moon system from an external perspective
- Rotate the camera by dragging with your mouse
- Zoom with the scroll wheel
- Watch how the Moon's lit side always faces the Sun

### Arizona Sky View
- Switch to this view to see what an observer in Arizona would see
- Shows the night sky with stars visible
- The Moon appears at its actual phase based on orbital position
- Ground plane represents the Arizona desert horizon
- Demonstrates how the same Moon shows different phases depending on its position

## The 8 Main Lunar Phases

### New Moon (0°)
- Moon is between Earth and Sun
- Dark side faces Earth
- Moon rises and sets with the Sun (not visible at night)

### Waxing Crescent (45°)
- Small sliver of light on right side
- Visible in evening sky after sunset

### First Quarter (90°)
- Right half illuminated
- Visible from noon to midnight
- Called "quarter" because it's 1/4 of the way through the cycle

### Waxing Gibbous (135°)
- More than half lit, growing toward full
- Visible most of the night

### Full Moon (180°)
- Moon opposite the Sun (Earth in middle)
- Fully illuminated face toward Earth
- Rises at sunset, sets at sunrise

### Waning Gibbous (225°)
- More than half lit, shrinking
- Visible late evening through morning

### Last Quarter (270°)
- Left half illuminated
- Visible from midnight to noon

### Waning Crescent (315°)
- Small sliver on left side
- Visible in morning sky before sunrise

## Key Concepts for Flat Earth Skeptics

### The Phases Prove Spherical Geometry

1. **Consistent Pattern**: The phases follow a predictable 29.5-day cycle that matches orbital mechanics
2. **Light Direction**: The illuminated part always points toward the Sun's position
3. **No Earth Shadow**: Most phases are NOT caused by Earth's shadow (only lunar eclipses are)
4. **Visible from Everywhere**: The same phase is visible from all locations on Earth at the same time

### What About Lunar Eclipses?

During a lunar eclipse:
- Earth IS between the Sun and Moon
- Earth's ROUND shadow passes across the Moon
- This proves Earth is spherical
- Eclipses are different from phases

### Observable Facts

- **The Moon orbits Earth**: Takes ~27.3 days (sidereal month)
- **The phase cycle**: Takes ~29.5 days (synodic month - longer because Earth moves too)
- **The tilt**: Moon's orbit is tilted ~5° (why we don't get eclipses every month)
- **Same face**: The Moon is tidally locked (same side always faces Earth)

## Experiment Ideas

### 1. Track the Real Moon
- Use the simulation to predict tonight's phase
- Go outside and observe the actual Moon
- Does it match? (Spoiler: It will!)

### 2. Watch a Full Cycle
- Run the simulation at high speed
- Watch how the lit portion smoothly transitions
- Note how it's always the Sun-facing side that's lit

### 3. Compare Views
- Switch between Space View and Arizona Sky View
- See how the same geometry looks from different perspectives
- Understand why Earth-based observers see what they do

### 4. Eclipse Prediction
- When the Moon is at 180° (Full Moon) and everything aligns
- Earth's shadow can cross the Moon
- This is a lunar eclipse (rare because of the 5° tilt)

## Common Misconceptions Debunked

### ❌ "The phases are caused by Earth's shadow"
**✅ Truth**: Phases are caused by viewing angle, NOT shadow. Only lunar eclipses involve Earth's shadow.

### ❌ "We should always see a full moon if the Sun lights it"
**✅ Truth**: We only see the portion of the lit half that faces us. Geometry!

### ❌ "The Moon landing was faked because the shadows were wrong"
**✅ Truth**: Shadows on the Moon work exactly as physics predicts. This simulation proves it.

### ❌ "It's impossible for us to see the Moon during the day"
**✅ Truth**: During certain phases (First/Last Quarter), the Moon is visible during daylight hours.

## Advanced Topics

### Why 29.5 Days Instead of 27.3?

The Moon orbits Earth in 27.3 days (sidereal month), but Earth is also orbiting the Sun. So the Moon needs an extra ~2 days to "catch up" to the same Sun-Earth-Moon alignment. This is the synodic month (29.5 days).

### Libration

The Moon appears to wobble slightly, letting us see ~59% of its surface over time (not just 50%). This simulation uses a simplified tidally-locked rotation, but real-world libration is more complex.

### Why No Eclipse Every Month?

The Moon's orbit is tilted ~5° relative to Earth's orbit around the Sun. So most months, the Moon passes "above" or "below" Earth's shadow at Full Moon, preventing an eclipse.
